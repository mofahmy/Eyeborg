# JEyeborg
`JEyeborg` is a sonochromatism [[1]](#links) (color to sound perception) simulator written in Java.
It is inspired by the Eyeborg [[2]](#links) concept in Neil Harbisson's "I see color" TED Talk [[3]](#links).

Microtone synthesis is achieved using JFugue [[4]](#links).

## Usage
Dragging the mouse along an image loaded into `JEyeborg` will play the notes associated with image pixels traversed by the cursor.
